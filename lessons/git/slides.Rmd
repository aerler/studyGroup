## Learning expectations ##

This won't even touch the surface of git... But! Hopefully, you:

* Recognize the power of using version control
* Know the basic tools to get started using git
* Where to go for help

## 4 main concepts ##

* **Start repository**: git init, git clone (GitHub)
* **Check activity**: git status, git log, git diff
* **Save to history**: git add, git commit
* **Move through the history**: git checkout

And maybe (if time):

* **Synchronizing with GitHub**: git push, git pull

## Different areas in Git ##
